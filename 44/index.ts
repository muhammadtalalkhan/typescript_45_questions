// Sandwiches: Write a function that accepts a array of items a person wants on a sandwich. 
// The function should have one parameter that collects as many items as the function call provides, 
// and it should print a summary of the sandwich that is being ordered. Call the function three times, 
// using a different number of arguments each time.
